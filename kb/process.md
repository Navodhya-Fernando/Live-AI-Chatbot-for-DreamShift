# DreamShift Process Overview

DreamShift provides an end-to-end, all-in-one job search toolkit. Our process combines personal branding, ATS optimization, visual positioning, and job-market intelligence.

We focus on **three pillars**:
- Brand you correctly (resume + LinkedIn)
- Align you with the job market (ATS keywords + job research)
- Reduce your workload (templates, guides, strategy)

## 1. Free Consultation (Optional)
Before starting, you may book a free consultation to:
- Clarify your target roles
- Discuss industries and locations
- Identify challenges and strengths
- Recommend the most suitable package

This call helps us make sure you invest in the right solution.

## 3. Document Collection
We request:

This step reveals what makes you special.

We can provide **multiple versions** if you are targeting different roles.

All files are **fully editable Word documents**, plus PDFs.
